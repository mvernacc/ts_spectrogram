## Development workflow

After cloning, run `npm i` to install this Node package and its dependencies.

The source files for the site are in the root directory and in `src/`.
Github pages serves the site from `docs/`. The files in `docs/` are generated by [snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). To update the site:

```bash
npm run build  # runs tsc and snowpack to build the site, outputs to docs/
git add docs/*
git ci -m "..."
git push
```

To serve a local version to experiment with during development, run
```bash
npm run start # launches the snowpack dev server
```

If you change a `.ts` file, you will need to re-run `tsc` in another terminal for your changes to take effect. Snowpack will automatically detect changes to other files.
